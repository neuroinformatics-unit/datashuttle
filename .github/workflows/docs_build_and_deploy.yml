name: Build Sphinx docs and deploy to GitHub Pages

# Generate the documentation on all merges to main, all pull requests, or by
# manual workflow dispatch. The build job can be used as a CI check that the
# docs still build successfully. The deploy job only runs when a tag is
# pushed and actually moves the generated html to the gh-pages branch
# (which triggers a GitHub pages deployment).
