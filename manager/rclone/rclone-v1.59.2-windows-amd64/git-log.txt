    config: move locking to fix fatal error: concurrent map read and map write

    Before this change we assumed that github.com/Unknwon/goconfig was
    threadsafe as documented.

    However it turns out it is not threadsafe and looking at the code it
    appears that making it threadsafe might be quite hard.

    So this change increases the lock coverage in configfile to cover the
    goconfig uses also.

    Fixes #6378

    azureblob,b2,s3: fix chunksize calculations producing too many parts

    Before this fix, the chunksize calculator was using the previous size
    of the object, not the new size of the object to calculate the chunk
    sizes.

    This meant that uploading a replacement object which needed a new
    chunk size would fail, using too many parts.

    This fix fixes the calculator to take the size explicitly.

    local: disable xattr support if the filesystems indicates it is not supported

    Before this change, if rclone was run with `-M` on a filesystem
    without xattr support, it would error out.

    This patch makes rclone detect the not supported errors and disable
    xattrs from then on. It prints one ERROR level message about this.
