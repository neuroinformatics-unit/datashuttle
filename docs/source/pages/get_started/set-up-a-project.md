# Set up a project

The first section of this guide will
set up a "local-only" project that can manage creation
and validation of project folders. This requires
only minimal configuration to get started.

To see how a datashuttle project can be set up for transfer,
visit [Set up a project for transfer](set-up-a-project-for-transfer) section.

Selecting `Make New Project` will take you to the project set up screen.

Enter the name of your project, the path to your project folder and
select `No connection (local only)` (note that the central-path option
is now disabled).

:::{tab-item} Python API
:sync: python

First, import ``datashuttle`` and set up a project with the ``project_name``.
If a project already exists, this should match the project folder name (i.e. the level above ``rawdata``).


```python

from datashuttle import DataShuttle

project = DataShuttle("my_project_name")

```

Next, give ``datashuttle`` the path to the project folder (this can,
but doesn't have to, include the ``project_name``)

```python

project.make_config_file(
    local_path=r"C:\MyUsername\my_data\my_project_name"
)

```
\
The project is now ready for use, and in future can be instantiated only
with the line ``project = DataShuttle("my_project_name")`` (i.e. you will not
have to set the `local_path` again).

If you wish to change the project settings at a later time, use ``project.update_config_file()``.

For example, it is possible to immediately validate the project (if it already exists):

```python
project.validate_project("rawdata", error_or_warn="warn")
```

Setting ``error_or_warn`` will display all validation issues, otherwise
it will error on the first one encountered.

New project folders can also be created in the local folder:

```python
project.create_folders("rawdata", "sub-001", "ses-001_@DATE@", datatype=["ephys", "behav"])
```

:::
::::

Now, this project is ready for creating and validating
folders to the [NeuroBlueprint](https://neuroblueprint.neuroinformatics.dev/latest/index.html) standard. See [create folders](how-to-create-folders)
and [validate folders](tutorial-validation) for details.

If you would also like to transfer files to a central machine, see the next section.

(set-up-a-project-for-transfer)=
## Set up a project for transfer

Above, we have set up a ``datashuttle`` project by providing the **project name**
and **local path**. Transfer across the local filesystem or via SSH is supported.
Therefore, we will need to provide:

1) **central path**: location of the project on the central storage machine.
2) Connection-specific settings (e.g. if using SSH).

```{image} /_static/datashuttle-overview-dark.png
   :align: center
   :class: only-dark
   :width: 500px
```
```{image} /_static/datashuttle-overview-light.png
   :align: center
   :class: only-light
   :width: 500px
```
<br>

How the **central path** is set depends on whether your connection to
central storage is a
[mounted drive](new-project-mounted-drive)
or via
[SSH](new-project-ssh).

If you are unsure of your connection method, speak to your lab administrator
or IT department.

(new-project-mounted-drive)=
### Connecting to central storage through a mounted drive

In this case, the central storage machine is mounted as a drive
on the local machine.

We simply need to set the **central path** as the path to
the central project as it appears on the local machine's filesystem.

:::{dropdown} Local Filesystem Example
:color: info
:icon: info

Imagine your central storage is a remote server that is mounted to
your machine at `X:\username`. You want your project folder to
be located at `X:\username\my_projects`.

In this case, you can set the **central_path** to `X:\username\my_projects`
and with **connection_method** to **local filesystem**.

The project folder will be located
at `X:\username\my_projects\my_project_name`.
You may pass the local or central path without the **project name**,
(it will be automatically included).

```
<br>

(general-tui-datashuttle-setup)=
Setting up ``datashuttle`` is as simple as entering the `Project name`,
`Local Path` and `Central Path` into the relevant input boxes.

The paths do not need to end in the project nameâ€”it will be automatically added.
You can paste a path into the input boxes with `CTRL+V or use `Select`
to navigate to paths on your local filesystem.

By default, the `Connection Method` is set to `Local Filesystem`,  so
this does not need to be changed.

Once all information is input, click `Save` to set up the project.
You can then navigate to the `Project Manager` screen by clicking the
``Go To Project Screen`` that appears.

```{note}
The contents of the input boxes can be copied with
with `CTRL+Q`, or opened in the system filebrowser with `CTRL+O`.
```

:::{tab-item} Python API
:sync: python

We will first import the `DataShuttle` class and initialise
it with the `project_name`:


```{code-block} python
from datashuttle import DataShuttle

project = DataShuttle("my_first_project")

```

Next, the `make_config_file()` method can be used to set up a new
project with the desired **local path**, **central path** and
**connection method**.

```{code-block} python
project.make_config_file(
    local_path=r"C:\my_local_machine\username\my_projects\my_first_project",
    central_path=r"X:\a_mounted_drive\username\my_projects\my_first_project",
    connection_method="local_filesystem",
)
```

(new-project-ssh)=
### Connecting to central storage through SSH

Another common method of connecting to a central storage machine is via
[SSH](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/protocol).

To set up SSH connection
we need to provide:

1) **central_host_id:** This is the address of the server you want to connect to.

2) **central_host_username:** This is your profile username on the server you want to
connect to.

3) **central path**: This is the path to the project *on the server*.

:::{dropdown} SSH Example
:color: info
:icon: info

Let's say the central project was stored on a remote server with
address `ssh.swc.ucl.ac.uk`, and your account username on the server
is `myusername`.

We want to store the project at the location (on the server)
`/ceph/my_lab/my_name/my_projects/project_name/`.

Then the settings would be:

**central host id**: `ssh.swc.ucl.ac.uk`

**central host username**: `myusername`

**central path**: `/ceph/my_lab/my_name/my_projects/project_name/`

You may pass the **local path** and **central path** without
the **project name**, it will be automatically included.

Note that Linux-based shortcuts (e.g. `~` for home directory) are not permitted.

<br>

When setting up a new project, the **project name** and **local path**
can be input exactly the
[same as when setting without SSH](general-tui-datashuttle-setup).

Next, input the `Central Host ID`, `Central Host Username` and
`Central Path` as described above.

Clicking `Save` will save these project configs. A button
`Set up SSH Connection` will appear. Click to
confirm the server ID and enter your password
(you will only need to do this once).

:::
:::{tab-item} Python API
:sync: python

The `connection_method` configuration must be set to `"ssh"`
to use the SSH protocol for data transfers.

Enter the `central_path`, `central_host_id` and
`central_host_username` as  described above.

```{code-block} python
project.make_config_file(
	local_path=r"C:\path\to\local\my_projects\my_first_project",
	central_path="/nfs/path_on_server/myprojects/central",
	connection_method="ssh",
	central_host_id="ssh.swc.ucl.ac.uk",
	central_host_username="username",
)
```

Next, a one-time command to set up the SSH connection must be run:

```{code-block} python
project.setup_ssh_connection()
```

Running `setup_ssh_connection()` will require verification
that the SSH server connected to is correct (pressing `y` to proceed).

Finally, your password to the central server will be requested (you will
only need to do this once).

(new-project-gdrive)=
### Connecting to central storage through Google Drive

Another common method of connecting to a central storage machine is via
[Google Drive](https://drive.google.com).

To set up Google Drive connection
we need to provide:

1) **gdrive_client_id:** This is the the client ID that allows you to connect to Google Drive.

2) **gdrive_root_folder_id:** This is the folder ID of the root folder you want to setup
connection to.

3) **central path**: This is the path to the project *relative to the root folder*.

:::{dropdown} Google Drive Example
:color: info
:icon: info

Let's say the central project was stored on a google drive folder
with root folder id `1KAN9QLD2K2EANE`, and your google drive client id
is `93412981629-2icf0ba09cks9skjkcrs85tinf73s2bqv.apps.googleusercontent.com`.

We want to store the project at the path (relative to the root folder)
`/my_name/my_projects/project_name/`.

Then the settings would be:

**gdrive root folder id**: `1KAN9QLD2K2EANE`

**gdrive client id**: `93412981629-2icf0ba09cks9skjkcrs85tinf73s2bqv.apps.googleusercontent.com`

**central path**: `/my_name/my_projects/project_name/`

(new-project-aws)=
### Connecting to central storage through AWS

To set up AWS connection we need to provide:

1) **aws_access_key_id:** This is the the access key ID that allows you to connect to AWS buckets.

2) **aws_region:** This is the region of your AWS bucket.

3) **central path**: This is the path to the project. Remember, the central path must start with the name of your AWS bucket.

:::{dropdown} AWS Example
:color: info
