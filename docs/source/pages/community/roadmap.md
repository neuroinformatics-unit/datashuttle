# Roadmap

The roadmap for **datashuttle**
contains our development plans for the package.
The roadmap is responsive to the requirements
of the community and we encourage people to get in
contact to outline their needs and priorities.

The aim of the first version (v0.4) was to support folder
creation, transfer and logging of projects organised to
**NeuroBlueprint** (v0.2) standard. Our current goals are to
support implementation of metadata standardisation planned for the next
NeuroBlueprint version and facilitate conversion to NWB and customisation.

**Q4 2024**

Standardised metadata support.

**Q2 2025**

Export of NeuroBlueprint projects to [Neurodata Without Borders](https://www.nwb.org/) format.

**Q4 2025**

Support for customising data structure (e.g. specific mandatory elements or new file types).
