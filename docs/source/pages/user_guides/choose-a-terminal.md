# Choose a terminal

``datashuttle``'s graphical interface can run in almost any terminal—but
native Windows and macOS terminals may display with rendering errors.
See below for recommended terminals for these operating systems.

If you are using Linux, the native terminal will work without issue.

## Choosing a terminal for Windows or macOS

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} Windows

For Windows, we recommend using
[Windows Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9n0dx20hk701?rtc=1&hl=en-gb&gl=GB)—Windows'
own high-powered terminal available for free on the
Microsoft Store.

``datashuttle`` will run in Command Prompt (`cmd.exe`), PowerShell (`ps.exe`)
or [Anaconda Prompt](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/getting-started/index.html),
but may display with rendering errors.

:::

:::{tab-item} macOS

On macOS we recommend using next-generation terminal emulators such
as [Warp](https://warp.dev/)
or [Wezterm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/index.html).
Both come with easy-to-use installers.

``datashuttle`` will run on the native macOS terminal but may display
with rendering errors.
