# Set up configurations for transfer

This guide will cover all you need to know for setting up a new project
in ``datashuttle`` for transfer. If you just want to create and validate
folders, see [set up a local project](set-up-a-local-project).

First, make sure you have
[installed and launched ``datashuttle``](how-to-install).

Next, we set up ``datashuttle`` on a new machine we must tell it three things:

1) **project name**: The name of the project (must be the same for all
local machines tied to a project).
2) **local path**: location of the project our local machine.
3) **central path**: location of the project on the central data storage machine.

```
```{image} /_static/datashuttle-overview-light.png
   :align: center
   :class: only-light
   :width: 500px
```
<br>

How the **central path** is set depends on whether your connection to
central storage is as a
[mounted drive](new-project-mounted-drive)
or via
[SSH](new-project-ssh).

If you are unsure of your connection method, speak to your lab administrator
or IT department.

(new-project-mounted-drive)=
## When central storage is a mounted drive

In this case, the central storage machine is mounted as a drive
on the local machine.

We simply need to set the **central path** as the path to
the central project as it appears on the local machine's filesystem.

:::{dropdown} Local Filesystem Example
:color: info
:icon: info

Imagine your central storage is a remote server that is mounted to
your machine at `X:\username`. You want your project folder to
be located at `X:\username\my_projects`.

In this case, you can set the **central_path** to `X:\username\my_projects`
and with **connection_method** to **local filesystem**.

The project folder will be located
at `X:\username\my_projects\my_project_name`.
You may pass the local or central path without the **project name**,
(it will be automatically included).

First, click the `Make New Project` button from the launch page.

The `Make New Project` screen will be displayed:

Setting up ``datashuttle`` is as simple as entering the `Project name`,
`Local Path` and `Central Path` into the relevant input boxes.

The paths do not need to end in the project nameâ€”it will be automatically added.
You can paste a path into the input boxes with `CTRL+V or use `Select`
to navigate to paths on your local filesystem.

By default, the `Connection Method` is set to `Local Filesystem`,  so
this does not need to be changed.

Once all information is input, click `Save` to set up the project.
You can then navigate to the `Project Manager` screen by clicking the
``Go To Project Screen`` that appears.

```{note}
The contents of the input boxes can be copied with
with `CTRL+Q`, or opened in the system filebrowser with `CTRL+O`.
```

:::{tab-item} Python API
:sync: python

We will first import the `DataShuttle` class and initialise
it with the `project_name`:


```{code-block} python
from datashuttle import DataShuttle

project = DataShuttle("my_first_project")

```

Next, the `make_config_file()` method can be used to set up a new
project with the desired **local path**, **central path** and
**connection method**.

```{code-block} python
project.make_config_file(
    local_path=r"C:\my_local_machine\username\my_projects\my_first_project",
    central_path=r"X:\a_mounted_drive\username\my_projects\my_first_project",
    connection_method="local_filesystem",
)
```

(new-project-ssh)=
## Connecting to central storage via SSH

Another common method of connecting to a central storage machine is via
[SSH](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/protocol).

To set up SSH connection
we need to provide:

1) **central_host_id:** This is the address of the server you want to connect to.

2) **central_host_username:** This is your profile username on the server you want to
connect to.

3) **central path**: This is the path to the project *on the server*.

:::{dropdown} SSH Example
:color: info
:icon: info

Let's say the central project was stored on a remote server with
address `ssh.swc.ucl.ac.uk`, and your account username on the server
is `myusername`.

We want to store the project at the location (on the server)
`/ceph/my_lab/my_name/my_projects/project_name/`.

Then the settings would be:

**central host id**: `ssh.swc.ucl.ac.uk`

**central host username**: `myusername`

**central path**: `/ceph/my_lab/my_name/my_projects/project_name/`

You may pass the **local path** and **central path** without
the **project name**, it will be automatically included.

Note that Linux-based shortcuts (e.g. `~` for home directory) are not permitted.

When setting up a new project, the **project name** and **local path**
can be input exactly the
[same as when setting without SSH](general-tui-datashuttle-setup).

Next, input the `Central Host ID`, `Central Host Username` and
`Central Path` as described above.

Clicking `Save` will save these project configs. A button
`Setup SSH Connection` will appear. Click to
confirm the server ID and enter your password
(you will only need to do this once).

:::{tab-item} Python API

The `connection_method` configuration must be set to `"ssh"`
to use the SSH protocol for data transfers.

Enter the `central_path`, `central_host_id` and
`central_host_username` as  described above.

```{code-block} python
project.make_config_file(
	local_path=r"C:\path\to\local\my_projects\my_first_project",
	central_path="/nfs/path_on_server/myprojects/central",
	connection_method="ssh",
	central_host_id="ssh.swc.ucl.ac.uk",
	central_host_username="username",
)
```

Next, a one-time command to set up the SSH connection must be run:

```{code-block} python
project.setup_ssh_connection()
```

Running `setup_ssh_connection()` will require verification
that the SSH server connected to is correct (pressing `y` to proceed).

Finally, your password to the central server will be requested (you will
only need to do this once).
